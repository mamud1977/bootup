            "Brook, 8 not out overnight, was particularly culpable for setting the tone for a careless batting performance. He was given out to his third ball of the day, after aiming a wild drive at Lahiru Kumara, and though he successfully overturned that caught-behind verdict, he was then badly dropped by Asitha Fernando at deep point on 12, after giving the charge to Milan Rathnayake.\n",

He singled out Brook for particular criticism, given the extraordinary strides he's already made in his career, particularly in his breakthrough winter of 2023-24, when he racked up 809 runs in nine innings, at a strike-rate of 98.77.\n",
